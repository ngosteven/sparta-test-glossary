# Sparta Test Glossary

### Absence of Error
### Acceptance testing
### Alpha testing

Alpha testing is simulated or actual operational testing by potential users/customers or an independent test team at the developers’ site. Alpha testing is often employed for off-the-shelf software as a form of internal acceptance testing, before the software goes to beta testing.

### Appium
### Automation Testing
Automated testing is the use of special software (separate from the software being tested) to control the execution of tests and the comparison of actual outcomes with predicted outcomes.

### Behaviour Driven Development
### Beta testing

Beta Testing is also known as field testing. It takes place at customer’s site. It sends the system/software to users who install it and use it under real-world working conditions.

### Black box testing
### Bottom up

Bottom-up testing is an approach to integrated testing where the lowest level components are tested first, then used to facilitate the testing of higher level components. 

### Boundary Value Analysis
### Capybara
Capybara is a web-based test automation software that simulates scenarios for user stories and automates web application testing for behavior-driven software development. It is a part of the Cucumber testing framework written in the Ruby programming language that simulates various aspects of a web browser from the perspective of a real user.
### Configuration Management
### Cucumber
### Data Parsing
### Debugging
The process of finding, analyzing and removing the causes of failures in software. Debugging tools are used to reproduce failures, investigate the state of programs and find the corresponding defect. Debuggers enable programmers to execute programs step by step, to halt a program at any program statement and to set and examine program variables.
### Defect
### Defect Clustering
### Dynamic Testing
### Early Testing
### Equivalence Partitions
### Error
### Error Guessing
### Evaluating Test Criteria
### Exhaustive testing
### Exploratory testing
### Failure
### Functional tests

### Gherkin Syntax
It is a Business Readable, Domain Specific Language that lets you describe software's behaviour without detailing how that behaviour is implemented. Gherkin serves two purposes — documentation and automated tests. 

### Hybrid
It is an approach to Integration Testing which is a combination of Top Down and Bottom Up approaches. 

### IEEE-829

Standard for Software Test Documentation
Eight defined stages of software testing:

* Test Plan
* Test Design Specification
* Test Case Specification
* Test Procedure Specification
* Test Item Transmittal Report
* Test Incident Report
* Test Log
* Test Summary Report

### ISTQB
### Incident management
### Integration testing
### JMeter
### Mike Cohn's test Pyramid

### Incident management
The process of recognizing, investigating, taking action and disposing of incidents. It involves logging incidents, classifying them and identifying the impact.

### Metric based testing
In software testing, Metric is a quantitative measure of the degree to which a system, system component, or process possesses a given attribute. In other words, metrics helps estimating the progress, quality and health of a software testing effort.

### Mobile testing
Mobile application testing is a process by which application software developed for handheld mobile devices is tested for its functionality, usability and consistency. Mobile application testing can be an automated or manual type of testing. <br>
Tool for testing an IOS app: Appium <br>
Tool for testing an Android app: Android Studio

### Non-functional tests
### Pesticide Paradox
### RSpec
RSpec is a 'Domain Specific Language' testing tool written in Ruby to test Ruby code. It is a behavior-driven development framework which is extensively used in the production applications.
### Regression Testing
### Restesting
### Reusability
### Reviews

## Risk Based Testing
An approach to testing to reduce the level of product risks and inform stakeholders of their status, starting in the initial stages of a project. It involves the identification of product risks and the use of risk levels to guide the test process.

### Selenium
### State Transition Testing
A black-box test design technique in which test cases are designed to execute valid and invalid state transitions.
### Statement Testing
A white-box test design technique in which test cases are designed to execute statements.
### Static testing

Static testing is the testing of the software work products manually, or with a set of tools. Code is not executed.

### Structural testing
### System Integration
### System testing
### Test Analysis and Design
### Test Case
A test case is a document which consists of a set of conditions or actions which are performed on the software application in order to verify the expected functionality of the feature. Here we describe the end to end logical flow of a specific requirement with test data, prerequisites and expected results.
### Test Closure
### Test Coverage
Test coverage measures the amount of testing performed by a set of test. Wherever we can count things and can tell whether or not each of those things has been tested by some test, then we can measure coverage and is known as test coverage.<br>
The basic coverage measure is where the ‘coverage item’ is whatever we have been able to count and see whether a test has exercised or used this item.
There is danger in using a coverage measure. But, 100% coverage does not mean 100% tested. Coverage techniques measure only one dimension of a multi-dimensional concept. Two different test cases may achieve exactly the same coverage but the input data of one may find an error that the input data of the other doesn’t.<br>
There are many different types of coverages which we will look at in detail, in subsequent topic, some of them are:
1. Statement coverage
2. Decision coverage
3. Condition coverage<br>

### Test Design
Creating a set of inputs for given software that will provide a set of expected outputs.  The idea is to ensure that the system is working good enough and it can be released with as few problems as possible for the average user.<br>
There are two main categories of Test Design Techniques:<br>
1. Static Techniques<br>
2. Dynamic Techniques

### Test Driven Development
### Test Implementation and Execution
### Test Planning and Control
### Test tools
### Testing Roles
#### Test lead/manager: A test lead is responsible for:

* Defining the testing activities for subordinates – testers or test engineers.
* All responsibilities of test planning.
* To check if the team has all the necessary resources to execute the testing activities.
* To check if testing is going hand in hand with the software development in all phases.
* Prepare the status report of testing activities.
* Required Interactions with customers.
* Updating project manager regularly about the progress of testing activities.
#### Test engineers/QA testers/QC testers are responsible for:
* To read all the documents and understand what needs to be tested.
* Based on the information procured in the above step decide how it is to be tested.
* Inform the test lead about what all resources will be required for software testing.
* Develop test cases and prioritize testing activities.
* Execute all the test case and report defects, define severity and priority for each defect.
* Carry out regression testing every time when changes are made to the code to fix defects.
### Testing is context dependent
### Testing shows presence of defects

### Top down
Top-down integration testing is an integration testing technique used in order to simulate the behaviour of the lower-level modules that are not yet integrated.

### Traceability
### Unit testing

### Use Case testing
A black-box test design technique in which test cases are designed to execute scenarios of use cases.

### User journey/story
### Validation
### Verification
### White box testing

### YAML

YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) is a data serialization language. It is commonly used for configuration files, but could be used in many applications where data is being stored or transmitted.
