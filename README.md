### Bottom up 

Bottom-up testing is an approach to integrated testing where the lowest level components are tested first, then used to facilitate the testing of higher level components. 

### IEEE-829

Standard for Software Test Documentation
Eight defined stages of software testing:

* Test Plan
* Test Design Specification
* Test Case Specification
* Test Procedure Specification
* Test Item Transmittal Report
* Test Incident Report
* Test Log
* Test Summary Report

ISTQB
### Incident management
The process of recognizing, investigating, taking action and disposing of incidents. It involves logging incidents, classifying them and identifying the impact.

### Mobile testing
Mobile application testing is a process by which application software developed for handheld mobile devices is tested for its functionality, usability and consistency. Mobile application testing can be an automated or manual type of testing. <br>

### Risk Based Testing
>>>>>>> dfc8b226d1eaa9c13e547a95403cf5546a75a0e0
An approach to testing to reduce the level of product risks and inform stakeholders of their status, starting in the initial stages of a project. It involves the identification of product risks and the use of risk levels to guide the test process.

### Test Design
Creating a set of inputs for given software that will provide a set of expected outputs.  The idea is to ensure that the system is working good enough and it can be released with as few problems as possible for the average user.<br>
There are two main categories of Test Design Techniques:<br>
1. Static Techniques<br>
2. Dynamic Techniques

### YAML

YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) is a data serialization language. It is commonly used for configuration files, but could be used in many applications where data is being stored or transmitted.
